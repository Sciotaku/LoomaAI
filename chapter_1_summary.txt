The text discusses the concept of scientific units in physics. It explains that there are two types of units: fundamental units and derived units.

**Fundamental Units**

* Have independent existence and cannot be broken down into simpler forms
* Examples:
	+ Mass: kilogram (kg)
	+ Time: second (s)
	+ Length: meter (m)

There are seven fundamental units in the SI system:

1. Temperature: kelvin (K)
2. Luminous intensity: candela (cd)
3. Electric current: ampere (A)
4. Amount of substance: none

**Derived Units**

* Formed from combinations of fundamental units
* Examples:
	+ Density: kg/m^
	+ Force: newton (N) = kgm/s^
	+ Pressure: pascal (Pa) = kgm^-s^
* Many derived units have simpler names, such as newton and pascal

The text also provides a table showing various physical quantities and their corresponding units, including fundamental and derived units.

**Analysis of Unitwise Equation**

* The validity of an equation can be checked by analyzing the units involved in the equation
* Both sides of the equation must have the same unit
* Example: s = vxt is valid because m (left-hand side) is equal to ms^-1s (right-hand side)

Overall, the text provides a comprehensive introduction to scientific units and their importance in physics.
