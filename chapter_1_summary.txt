The text discusses the concept of scientific units in physics. There are two types of units:

1. **Fundamental units**: These are independent units that cannot be broken down into simpler forms. In the SI system, there are 7 fundamental units:
	* Temperature: Kelvin (K)
	* Luminous intensity: Candela (cd)
	* Electric current: Ampere (A)
	* Amount of substance: Mole (mol)
2. **Derived units**: These are combinations of two or more fundamental units to measure a physical quantity. Examples include:
	* Density: kg/m³
	* Force: N (newton) = kg·m/s²
	* Pressure: Pa (pascal) = kg/m·s²

The text also explains how to analyze the composition of derived units by breaking down the formula for a physical quantity into its fundamental units. For example, the unit of area is m² because it combines length and breadth.

Additionally, the text discusses the importance of unit analysis in checking the validity of scientific equations. It provides an example where performing unit analysis on an equation reveals whether it is valid or not.

Finally, the text concludes with an activity for students to find various units used to measure different physical quantities in their daily lives and classify them into fundamental and derived units.
